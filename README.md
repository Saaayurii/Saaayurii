Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a frontend developer with experience in various technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with C++, C#, and Python, as well as skills in Assembly language development.

ðŸš€ In my projects, I strive to create innovative and high-quality user interfaces that not only look good but also perform efficiently.

ðŸ’¡ My experience in various programming areas allows me to apply diverse approaches to problem-solving and find effective solutions.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm deeply diving into modern frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Next.js to expand my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.

ðŸ“« If you have any questions or collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out to me!

My name is **Roman**, and I've been involved in development since 2021.

In 2022, I enrolled at DGU, majoring in IT.
